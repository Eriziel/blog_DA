Many data analysts in Riyadh (or as much as I have met) still valiantly use Excel and/or SQL to perform analyses.
Some engage in SQL gymnastics for the simple operation of pivoting, whilst others wait for purchase of SAS licences, affirming that SAS has answers to all data related questions.

But why not to use a language/environment that was formulated for Statistical Data Analyses, by Data Analysts?

And if <a href="https://www.meetup.com/doha-rug/" target="_blank">Qatar/Doha</a> can have an R User Group, then why can Riyadh not have one too? ;)

<b>Announcing: Riyadh UseR Group</b>

I will be contacting various analysts I know in Riyadh to increase awareness about the group.  
If you happen to be living in Riyadh, do consider joining <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Riyadh-UseR-Group/" target="_blank">us</a>.  
We will soon announce when our first meetup will take place.
